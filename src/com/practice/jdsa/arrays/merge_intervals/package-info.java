/**
 * Scenario:
 * - Look for problems where you need to iterate through the array with two pointers,
 *  typically starting from different ends or positions within the array.
 * - Consider tasks that involve comparing or manipulating elements from two different
 * parts of the array simultaneously.
 * <p>
 * Clues:
 * Look for the problem descriptions mentioning a sorted array or the need to compare elements
 * from both the ends.
